the header, content and the footer section. In the header section there is a navbar which contains HOME,
ABOUT,SKILLS, BLOG and CONTACT.The navbar has a hover effect too and then under the body or content part 
it contains several sections like the Home part,where i have introduced myself a little bit, then there are two 
blocks of Download CV and hire.Then in the about section you'll get to know more about myself.In the skills
i have mentionedmy six skills and how you can learn or improve them. The skills are HTML/CSS skills,
Analytical skills,Responsive Design skills,Javascript skills,Interpersonal skills and Back end basics.
Then in the blog section, there are some of the blogs in which the first blog that is THE BEGINNNG is written by me 
and you'll find that blog in medium and the rest two blogs are dummy.In the contact section there
